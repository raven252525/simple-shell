In this project I built a POSIX compliant simple shell that's capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like
cd, pwd, echo, and handling single quotes. 

This program is compatible with any POSIX compliant system, and can be run locally using the script file. 

I utilized a tutorial from codecrafters to complete this project for educational purposes, along with understanding
how the shells runs in a more simple and digestable settiing.
